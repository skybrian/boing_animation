A Python [notebook](./notebook.ipynb) showing how to recreate the Amiga Boing Ball demo as an animated gif.

The Python code was originally all written by GPT4 and it ran in Code Interpreter. In the notebook I checked in here, I improved the visualizations of what the functions do, and they are in a different order than the original chat. Here is the [chat transcript](https://chat.openai.com/share/b46be053-ee4f-4487-9f18-4e85b701e3e1) where I finally talked GPT4 into making a working animation.

I had never used Python's Pillow or numpy libraries before this. Pretty neat!
